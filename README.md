# farty-vue
Farty Vue is a fun neural network usage experiment in which a neural network is trained on a desired classification space to map food attributes to a Fart type index.
As food items are clicked to feed Patrick his gut will start digesting the food items adding to his conceptual digestive system's levels of solid, fatty and fibrous food matter. Once the Gut threshold is reached  fart components are packed into a sequence in a small time window. Once enough components are packed in or a time release limit is reached the series of fart components will be release (played)

Currently this should run on Chrome for (PC/Mac) without issue.
